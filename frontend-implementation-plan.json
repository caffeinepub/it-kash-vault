Add unique accent colors for each button (e.g., bright red/orange for Airhorn, sickly green for Fart, muted yellow/brown for Sad Trombone, muted green for Crickets, deep purple for Evil Laugh, neon orange for '67'). Add thematic icons or emojis to each button that visually represent the sound (e.g., megaphone for Airhorn, cloud/puff for Fart, music note for Sad Trombone, bug for Crickets, skull for Evil Laugh). Ensure each button maintains its existing press/active state animation. Preserve the dark neon arcade theme with Chakra Petch or Exo 2 typography and ensure the '67' button retains its distinctive neon orange/cyan styling. Keep all buttons fully functional with their Web Audio API sound triggers."
