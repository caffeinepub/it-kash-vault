Load the image on component mount, draw it centered on the canvas as the clickable target, and apply the existing idle pulsing scale animation and click shake/flash effects to the rendered image. Preserve all existing game mechanics: combo multiplier logic, score increment, best score tracking, floating score text, and the TUNG! sound effect trigger. Ensure the image maintains proper centering and scaling within the canvas dimensions."
