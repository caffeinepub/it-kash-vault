      "title": "Completely rewrite the RetroBowlGame component in frontend/src/components/games/RetroBowlGame.tsx to faithfully replicate the original Retro Bowl game's mechanics, visuals, and feel. The game must be rendered on an HTML5 canvas using React. Core mechanics to implement: (1) Top-down/isometric-style field view with yard lines and end zones clearly marked. (2) The player controls the quarterback on offense — tap/click to select a receiver running a visible route (receivers animate down their routes), then tap/click again on the receiver to throw the ball with a leading-pass arc. The ball should travel realistically toward the selected target. (3) If the player does not throw in time, the QB scrambles/runs automatically. (4) On run plays, the ball carrier runs forward with the player steering by tapping left/right or clicking direction. (5) The defense is fully AI-controlled with defenders pursuing the ball carrier and attempting to intercept or tackle. (6) Implement complete football rules: 4 downs to gain 10 yards for a first down; touchdown (6 pts) + extra point attempt (1 pt); field goal option on 4th down (3 pts); safety (2 pts); punt option on 4th down; turnovers on downs. (7) CPU team also possesses the ball on offense with AI-controlled QB decisions — passing or running. (8) Track and display score for both teams (home vs away), current quarter (4 quarters), time remaining per quarter, down & distance, and yard line. (9) Play-calling screen before each offensive play: choose from Pass (with 2–3 route options shown) or Run (with direction options). (10) Receiver routes rendered as dotted/dashed lines on the field before the snap. (11) Tackle/collision animations when the ball carrier is brought down. (12) Display a halftime screen between Q2 and Q3. (13) Display a final score screen at game end with win/loss result and a 'Play Again' button. Style the game to closely match Retro Bowl's retro pixel/chunky aesthetic — use bold blocky player sprites drawn on canvas, bright green field with white yard lines and hash marks, visible team colors for each side, and a dark HUD bar at the top showing all game info. Use Chakra Petch or Exo 2 typography for all HUD and UI text.",
