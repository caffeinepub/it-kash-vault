# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the SoundpadPage buttons so each one has a distinct visual style that reflects the character and feel of its corresponding sound.

**Planned changes:**
- Assign each soundpad button a unique thematic accent color matching its sound's mood (e.g., bright red for Airhorn, sickly green for Fart, deep purple for Evil Laugh, neon orange for 67, muted yellow/brown for Sad Trombone, muted green for Crickets)
- Add a small thematic icon or emoji to each button that visually represents its sound
- Ensure no two buttons share the same color + icon combination
- Preserve the existing press/active animation on all buttons
- Retain the dark neon arcade theme (near-black background, Chakra Petch or Exo 2 font, neon glow effects)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can identify each sound button at a glance by its distinct color and icon, without needing to read the label, while the overall arcade aesthetic and button functionality remain unchanged.
