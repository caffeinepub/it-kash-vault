  "summary": "The diff modifies SoundpadPage.tsx to add distinct visual designs (icons, accent colors, labels, shapes) for each sound button, implementing REQ-70. The implementation covers themed icons, accent colors, border/bg/glow styles, shape variants, and subtexts for each button. The existing triggerSound mechanism with setTimeout animation reset is preserved. The file is truncated so some buttons (notably '67' and 'Evil Laugh') are not fully visible, but the structure and partial content suggest they are likely implemented similarly.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-70",
      "requirement": "The '67' button has a visually distinct style consistent with its neon orange/cyan accent established in the previous feature.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated and does not show the '67' button definition. It cannot be confirmed that it is present with the required neon orange/cyan styling.",

      "requirement": "'Evil Laugh' gets a deep purple with a skull/laugh icon.",
