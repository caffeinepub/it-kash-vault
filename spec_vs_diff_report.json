  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-32, REQ-33, REQ-34) appear to be implemented in the diff. SixSevenGame.tsx is created as a canvas-based clicker game with the required features, GamePage.tsx is updated to register the '67 clicker' slug mapping to SixSevenGame, and seedGames.ts includes the '67 Clicker' entry with the correct fields. Minor details like the meme-inspired face/character drawing are truncated but the canvas-based character rendering is evident. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features are detected.",
