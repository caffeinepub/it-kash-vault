  "summary": "The diff modifies RetroBowlGame.tsx with a comprehensive rewrite implementing most REQ-59 requirements. However, due to truncation of the file diff, several acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified. Based on visible code, the implementation includes field rendering, HUD, player types, game phases (HALFTIME, GAME_OVER, EXTRA_POINT, PLAY_CALL, etc.), ball flight mechanics, and tackle timers. Several specific ACs are partially or potentially missing based on what is visible.",

      "id": "REQ-59",
      "requirement": "Tackle/collision animations play when the ball carrier is brought down.",
      "reason": "While a 'tackleTimer' field exists in the Player interface, no explicit tackle animation drawing code is visible in the truncated diff. The presence of a timer field is insufficient to confirm animated tackle/collision visuals are rendered.",
