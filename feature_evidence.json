      "featureTitle": "Build an in-browser '67 Clicker' game using React and canvas, themed around the 'six seven' meme. The player clicks (or taps) a large central character/image representing the 'six seven' meme to score points. Each click produces a '67!' hit effect with a visual flash/shake animation and a score increment. Include a combo multiplier that increases when the player clicks rapidly (within a short time window) and resets after a pause. Display the current score prominently and a best score (persisted in localStorage). Show a pulsing idle animation on the character when not being clicked. Style the game with the dark neon arcade theme consistent with the rest of the platform, using neon glow effects and bold Orbitron typography.",
