      "featureTitle": "Rewrite the RetroBowlGame component in frontend/src/components/games/RetroBowlGame.tsx to more faithfully replicate the look, feel, and mechanics of the original Retro Bowl mobile game. The field must use a top-down perspective with a bright green pitch, white yard lines, hash marks, and clearly marked end zones. Player sprites must be bold and blocky (retro pixel/chunky style) with distinct team colors for each side. The HUD bar at the top must display score (home vs. away), quarter, time remaining, down & distance, and current yard line. On offense, the player taps/clicks to select a receiver running an animated route (routes shown as dotted lines before the snap), then taps/clicks again to throw with a realistic leading-pass arc. If no throw is made in time the QB scrambles automatically. On run plays the ball carrier runs forward and the player steers left/right by clicking/tapping. AI defenders actively pursue the ball carrier and attempt tackles and interceptions. Full football rules must be enforced: 4 downs to gain 10 yards for a first down; touchdown (6 pts) + extra point attempt (1 pt); field goal option on 4th down (3 pts); safety (2 pts); punt option on 4th down; turnover on downs. The CPU team controls its own offense with AI QB decision-making (pass or run). A play-calling screen appears before each offensive play with Pass (2–3 visible route options) and Run (direction options) choices. Tackle/collision animations play when the ball carrier is brought down. A halftime screen appears between Q2 and Q3. A final score screen with win/loss result and a 'Play Again' button appears at game end. Use Chakra Petch or Exo 2 typography for all HUD and UI text, consistent with the site's neon theme.",
