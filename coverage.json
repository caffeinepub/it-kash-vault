        "summary": "Update each button in the SoundpadPage (frontend/src/pages/SoundpadPage.tsx) so that its visual design — including icon, accent color, label style, and/or button shape — reflects the character and feel of its corresponding sound. For example: 'Fart' gets a puff/cloud icon and a sickly green tint; 'Airhorn' gets a bold red/orange color and a megaphone icon; 'Sad Trombone' gets a muted yellow/brown tone and a music note; 'Crickets' gets a muted green and a bug icon; 'Evil Laugh' gets a deep purple with a skull/laugh icon; '67' gets a neon orange flash styling. Each button must retain the existing press/active animation and the overall neon arcade theme (dark background, Chakra Petch or Exo 2 font), but differ from one another visually so a user can identify the button's sound at a glance without reading the label.",
